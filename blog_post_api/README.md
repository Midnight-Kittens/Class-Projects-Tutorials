### This was a tutorial making a simple blog post web app in Flask. 

### I wanted to work through this one because my data structure knowledge is not as good as it should be. 
### This made the project more challenging, as I was constantly having to go back and look up the data structures being used.
### Overall, I think this was good practice. I typically need to see how things are used to understand them, and seeing data structures be used in a web app helped me undestand their use.
